# aws-sagemaker-iris

Used the AWS SageMaker ML environment to build and deploy a decision tree classifier on the [Iris Data Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). 

The ```iris.csv``` dataset consists of 150 observations including a label and four predictors for each data point. The label denotes the flower's species from three Iris species: Setosa, Versicolor and Verginica encoded by 0, 1 and 2 respectively in the dataset. The features are the width and length of the flower's petals and sepals.
